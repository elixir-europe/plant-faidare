# About this data portal

The purpose of this portal is to facilitate the discoverability of public data on plant biology from a federation of established data repositories.

It is based on the [Breeding API (BrAPI)](https://brapi.org/) specifications and facilitates the access to genotype and phenotype datasets for crop and forest plants through an easy to use web interface.
It also provides a standard interface that can be accessed programatically through [web services](https://urgi.versailles.inrae.fr/faidare/swagger-ui.html).

It is an extension of the generic [Data-Discovery portal](https://forgemia.inra.fr/urgi-is/data-discovery), a web portal that allows finding any type of data across several databases through a lightweight keyword based search.
FAIDARE offers more detailed search and data retrieval capabilities and it takes advantage of the growing adoption of the BrAPI.

It has been developed by [INRAE-URGI](https://urgi.versailles.inrae.fr/) in collaboration with [**Elixir Plant**](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/plant-sciences), [**Phenome-Emphasis.fr**](https://www.phenome-emphasis.fr/phenome_eng/Methodological-projects/MCP2-Distributed-Information-system) and [**Elixir-fr/IFB**](https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr).
